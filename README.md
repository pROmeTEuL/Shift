# Shift

Shift is an improvised shell made in swift.
It has some useful commands such as:
- echo
- calc
I will try to update it as often as possible.
To use it, first type your name. Then type "help" to see what commands are available.
Try to use backspace instead of left and right arrow in case you make a mistake. 
Have fun with it!
I am open for new ideas :D
